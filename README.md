## üöÄ Projected Features

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Pokemon Card Information**
- **Dashboard** displaying Pokemon cards from each set in an easily identifiable manner.
- **Filters** for setting and organizing sets to easily identify your specific chase cards.
- **Integration with price monitoring** to make better insights into whether a specific booster pack or box is worth a certain price depending on the Chase card's prices.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Price monitoring**
- **Web scraping** tools are used to monitor multiple websites for certain cards or products and will update every 15 minutes for API request optimization.
  - Why every 15 minutes? this is because Pokemon cards generally do not have high volatility and would optimise API fetch calls allowing much faster rendering with less overhead.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Price analytics for purchase decisions**
- **Statistical formulas** to gauge expected returns of specific goods depending on current market price and card set.
- **Risk analysis** to provide a gauge of how much risk the user is willing to take and when a price point is too high.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Insights**
- **Model training** Identify keep topics and regions to ingest data in which can provide a relationship into speculating card prices.
